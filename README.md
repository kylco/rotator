# rotator
The most basic of scripts to randomly rotate images from a folder, for example a rotating signature for message boards.

Installtion
1. Make a new folder on your host. The name doesn't matter but I will use "/sig" in this example.
2. Add the provided index.php file to /sig/
3. Create a new folder in /sig and named it "image.png" (Yes, name the new folder "image.png"
4. Upload whatever images you want to be randomly rotated into the folder image.png
5. If you're using it on a message board the [img] [/img] tags will display a signature that changes when the pages refreshes.
